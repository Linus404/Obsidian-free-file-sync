### Important Notes
1. You don't have Obsidian Sync features like Version history or AES‑256 end-to-end encryption
2. You need to trust a third party app all your data
3. You need Google Drive or One Drive
4. The aim of this guide is to save your Markdown files and media in the cloud and edit it from your smartphone or tablet without any extra costs.
5. The authors of this guide are not responsible for possible damages of any kind.  

Idea: Create and use Vault in cloud  
Problem: Mobile app got no access to cloud  
Solution:  

## Setup (Google Drive - mirror files - Windows and Android)
In this guide I will use Google Drive as my cloud storage service, a Windows machine as PC, an Android smartphone and *Autosync for Google Drive*.
1. Download [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) and follow the setup instructions.
2. If no Drive window stays open, click on the up arrow next to your windows date and time on the bottom right of your monitor and right-click the Google Drive logo -> settings

4. This windows will open and you need to chose between *Stream files* and *Mirror files*. Chose your preferred option — for more information visit [Google Drive Help](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/13401938?hl=en) ![Drive-options](https://snipboard.io/nVtTSN.jpg)
5. You may have chosen a custom path during setup. On that file path, you have direct access to your Drive root-folder. Every file and folder you save in there or in subfolders, will get copied into your Google Drive. Same vice versa. Open Obsidian and create a new vault or change the directory of an existing vault to your file path. By default the path is a new Drive name *Google Drive (G:)*. You can change that in the settings.
6. That's it for the PC part. All your files and folders you create via Obsidian will get saved on your Google Drive.
7. When you want to open a vault with the Obsidian mobile App, you can only chose from your internal storage. You cant chose your Google Drive. Google Drive on the other hand gives you no option of mirroring files on your smartphone like we did with the PC. To fix this you need to download *Autosync for Google Drive* or *FolderSync*

9. Follow the setup instructions from DriveSync (Autosync for Google Drive) and chose the file path where the vault is saved in
10. Look through the settings of DriveSync and chose if you want auto sync or not. I personally have it turned off because I dont have the App run constantly and when I need to work with Obsidian, I manually sync.
11. Open the Obsidian App and *open folder as vault*
12. Chose the path you picked while setting up DriveSync. Done.
